### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my public repo! Here I have a list of projects I am working on. I have a variety of data visualization projects published through Power Bi, which can be access through the links below. Please let me know your thoughts and feedback!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on IBM Machine Learning Certificate
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects
